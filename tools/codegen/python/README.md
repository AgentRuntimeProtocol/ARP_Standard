# Python Codegen (placeholder)

The canonical source of truth is `spec/`. Python SDK artifacts live under `sdks/python/`.

In `v1alpha1` the SDK is provided as a small, typed client/model layer aligned with the schemas and OpenAPI.
Future iterations can switch to deterministic codegen from bundled OpenAPI.
